Explanation
--------------

if length(A) > 1

If the array has 1 or 0 elements, it’s already sorted — stop splitting.

Find the midpoint 
mid = length(A) / 2
Used to split the array into two halves.

Create two subarrays
left = A[0 to mid - 1]
right = A[mid to end]

Recursively sort each half
MergeSort(left)
MergeSort(right)
Each half gets split again and again until you end up with many arrays of size 1.

Merge the two sorted halves
Merge(left, right, A)
After both halves are individually sorted, you combine them into the original array A.
